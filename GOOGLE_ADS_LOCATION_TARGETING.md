# Google Ads Location Targeting - International Buyers

## 🎯 Your Situation
- **Target Audience:** International buyers (English-speaking)
- **Property Location:** French Riviera (Nice, Cannes, Monaco, etc.)
- **Challenge:** Buyers are searching from their home countries, not from France

---

## ✅ Recommended Configuration

### Option 1: Presence OR Interest (BEST for International Buyers)

**What to do:**
1. **Keep your current locations** (Nice, Cannes, Monaco, Antibes, Menton) ✅
2. **Change targeting setting** to "Presence or Interest" instead of just "Presence"

**How to change:**
- Look for location targeting options (usually in advanced settings)
- Change from "People in your targeted locations" to **"People in or who show interest in your targeted locations"**

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Shows ads to people IN the French Riviera (local buyers)
- ✅ Shows ads to people INTERESTED in the French Riviera (international buyers searching from abroad)
- ✅ Catches people searching "buy property in Nice" from UK, USA, etc.

### Option 2: Add English-Speaking Countries (Alternative Strategy)

**Add these countries to your targeting:**

#### Primary Countries (High Priority):
1. **United Kingdom** (UK) - Major market for French property
2. **United States** (USA) - High purchasing power
3. **Canada** - Strong interest in French property
4. **Australia** - Growing market
5. **Ireland** - Close to UK market

#### Secondary Countries:
6. **New Zealand**
7. **South Africa** (English-speaking)
8. **Switzerland** (many English speakers)
9. **Belgium** (English-speaking expats)

**How to add:**
- Click "Add location"
- Search for country names
- Add them to your targeting list

**Strategy:**
- **French Riviera locations** = Where properties are
- **English-speaking countries** = Where buyers are searching from

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)

**Best of both worlds:**

1. **Keep French Riviera locations:**
   - Nice
   - Cannes

2. **Add English-speaking countries:**

   - United States
   - Canada
   - Australia

3. **Set to "Presence or Interest"** for all locations
