## 🎨 Image Design Tips

### Do's ✅
- Use high-quality, professional photos
- Ensure good lighting
- Show luxury/premium feel
- Include Nice/French Riviera scenery
- **Keep images clean - NO TEXT is best for Google Ads**
- Use images that match your ad copy
- Let the property speak for itself

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't use low-resolution images
- **Don't add text overlays** (Google prefers clean images)
- Don't use generic stock photos
- Don't use images that don't represent your properties
- **Don't include logos or branding text** (save that for your website)

### Why No Text? 🤔
- **Google's algorithm prefers clean images** - less text = better reach
- **Your ad copy already has the text** - titles and descriptions do the talking
- **Visual impact** - beautiful property images are more engaging
- **Better performance** - clean images typically get more clicks
- **Mobile-friendly** - text on images is hard to read on small screens

### If you have image editing software (Photoshop, Canva, etc.):

1. **Square Image:**
   - Open `/images/Properties/1/1.jpg`
   - Crop to 1200x1200px square
   - Focus on the best part of the property
   - Save as high-quality JPG

2. **Horizontal Image:**
   - Open `/images/Properties/1/1.jpg` or `hero-background.jpg`
   - Crop to 1200x628px (1.91:1 ratio)
   - Ensure it's wide and shows the location/property well
   - Save as high-quality JPG

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **NO TEXT on images** - Google Ads works best with clean, product-focused images
2. **Let the property sell itself** - Beautiful property photos are more effective than text overlays
3. **Your ad copy has the text** - Titles and descriptions already communicate your message
4. **Test different images** - Create 2-3 variations and see which performs best
5. **Match image to ad** - If ad is about "Luxury Villas", use villa image
6. **Update seasonally** - Change images to match seasons (summer = beach views)
7. **A/B test** - Test property images vs. landscape images
8. **Quality matters** - Use highest quality images you have

### When to Add Text (Rare Cases)
Only add minimal text if:
- You're running a special promotion (e.g., "New Listings")
- You need to highlight a unique selling point that can't be in ad copy
- Keep it to 1-2 words maximum
- Make it large and readable
- But honestly, **avoid it if possible** - clean images perform better
